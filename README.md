## Overview

_**IEDB** is the International EDM Database where you can find the latest releases, live performances and information of your favourite DJ's!_

### Created by

Created, designed, developed, directed, put together, assembled, and written by Richard M. Braamburg.  

### Permissions

All information used in **IEDB** are gathered from online free resources. New content can be added by users by providing URL's to the respective sources. Video footage will be gathered from online platforms like Youtube and Vimeo as long as the original user allows embedding the source. 

<br>

## MVP

_The **IEDB** minimum requirements for the app are to provide a public overview of video footage of EDM songs and show recordings. Additionally, an online portal will be created whereby users get the option to add new content by saving to the database. Also, every users gets the ability to comment on items in the DB._

<br>

### MVP Goals

- _Every visitor of the website should have access to all content in the DB (viewing permission)_
- _Users should have the ability to upload new content, edit their own content, delete their own content._
- _Users should have the ability to change user settings and credentials - reset password and change username etc._
- _Users shoudl be able to like / save posts to create their own favourites list._

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
